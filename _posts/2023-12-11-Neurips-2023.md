I am glad to participate as Visa chair for the LXAI workshop at Neurips 2023. The 6th Annual Latinx in AI Research workshop will be held on December 11th, 2023 at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, LA (USA), as a part of the 37th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). The workshop will embrace an hybrid format, welcoming attendees both onsite and virtually.
