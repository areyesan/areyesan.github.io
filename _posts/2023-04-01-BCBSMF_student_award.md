I am happy to announce that I have been selected as one of the recipient of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) Foundation Student Award. 
The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation Student Award Program supports medical and doctoral students in Michigan who aim to improve health care within the state.
The project “Development of a parameter-efficient Deep Learning algorithm for medical image segmentation as an effort to mitigate the disparities in access to healthcare resources for skin cancer in the Michigan Upper Peninsula” will benefict of the grant provided by the BCBSM Foundation to move forward with the research.
