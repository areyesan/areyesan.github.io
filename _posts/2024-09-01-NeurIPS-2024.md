I am glad to repeat my participation as Visa chair for the LXAI workshop at Neurips 2024. The 7th Annual Latinx in AI Research workshop will be held on December 10th, 2024 at the Vancaouver Convention Center in Vancouver, BC (Canada), as a part of the 38th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). The workshop will embrace an hybrid format, welcoming attendees both onsite and virtually.
