I am happy to announce that I have been selected as one of the recipient of the Doctoral Finishing Fellowship Award from the Michigan Tech Grad School. 
Each semester, the Graduate School anticipates awarding Finishing Fellowships that provide support to PhD candidates who are close to completing their degrees. These fellowships are available through the generosity of alumni and friends of the University. They are intended to recognize outstanding PhD candidates who are in need of financial support to finish their degrees and are also contributing to the attainment of goals outlined in The Michigan Tech Plan.
