# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a Second-year Ph.D. student in Prof. [Sidike Paheding](https://www.mtu.edu/applied-computing/about/faculty/ac-faculty/paheding/)'s [Research Group](https://mtu.edu) at [CS&E@MTU](https://www.mtu.edu/cse/). I received my B.S. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Purdue University Northwest. (PNW), Hammond, IN, where I was a member of the 2018 [Honors Colllege](https://www.pnw.edu/honors-college/). 


My research focuses on developing deep learning architectures for segmentation task in different areas such as hyperspectral, medical and geospatial imaging, with main focus in attention mechanism and loss optimization functions. In addition, I have been working in projects related to cybersecurity, software development and virtual reality.

My research has been published in many prestigious conferences, journal papers and posters presentations, including: CVPR 2022, MICCAI 2022, IEEE EIT 2022, and MDPI Electronics.


In addition, I love cybersecurity/hacking competitions and video game developemnt using engines such as Unity and Unreal.
